# JS-Prefix-Postfix
In JavaScript, prefix and postfix operators are used to increment (++) or decrement (--) a variable's value by 1
Mastering Prefix and Postfix Operators in JavaScript
Introduction
Welcome to Mastering Prefix and Postfix Operators in JavaScript! This repository is designed as a resource to help developers understand the subtle differences between prefix (++a, --a) and postfix (a++, a--) operators in JavaScript. These operators are commonly tested in technical interviews, where understanding the fine details of their behavior is crucial.

In this guide, youâ€™ll find explanations and detailed walk-throughs of challenging examples that showcase how increment and decrement operators work in real-world coding scenarios. These examples also highlight key concepts such as operator precedence and order of evaluationâ€”important for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers.

Why This Topic?
Understanding prefix and postfix operators can greatly improve your problem-solving skills in JavaScript, especially in scenarios with complex expressions. Top tech companies frequently test candidates on these nuances to gauge their attention to detail, logical thinking, and understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s evaluation process.
